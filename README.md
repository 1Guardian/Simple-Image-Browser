# Simple-Image-Browser
A simple Image viewer that formed the tkinter framework that was used in subsequent projects. 

## Notes
This was my first real experience using the tkinter framework, and I didn't make many improvements outside of using bindings for the key detection for my future projects. Beyond that, the class I create in this project remained largely unchanged for the rest of my projects. This project itself is just a simple image browser that takes in a directory and displays all images found within the folder and its sub folders. 

## Usage:
python browser.py -h  -r [rows ]-c [columns] -d [directory]
      <br>-h : Displays help menu
      -r : designates how many rows each image should be constrained to
      -c : designates how many columns each image should be constrained to
      -d : target directory
